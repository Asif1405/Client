# BagelDB Clients

This repository contains clients for BagelDB in two different programming languages: JavaScript and Python.

The goal of these clients is to simplify the process of interacting with the BagelDB API, allowing developers to focus on building applications without having to worry about HTTP requests or handling responses.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

1. **`/javascript`**: Contains the JavaScript client for BagelDB. Here you'll find the client itself along with instructions on how to use it, example code, and tests. For more information, see the [README](javascript/README.md) in the `/javascript` directory.

2. **`/python`**: Contains the Python client for BagelDB. Like the JavaScript directory, this also includes the client, usage instructions, examples, and tests. For more details, refer to the [README](python/README.md) in the `/python` directory.

## Getting Started

To get started with either the JavaScript or Python client, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided in the README.

Remember to always install the necessary dependencies and set up your environment variables correctly.

## Contributing
